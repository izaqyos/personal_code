# Python Concepts - Deep Dives

## How to Use Deep Dives

### When to Read
1. **After completing related practice week** - reinforce learning
2. **When building real projects** - need deeper understanding
3. **Before technical interviews** - comprehensive review
4. **When stuck on a concept** - detailed explanations

### How to Study
1. **Read through completely first** - get overview
2. **Type out examples** - don't just read code
3. **Experiment with variations** - break things to understand
4. **Relate to your work** - find real-world applications
5. **Take notes** - summarize key insights

### Integration with Practice Plan
- **Daily Practice** (10-15 min): Hands-on focused exercises
- **Deep Dives** (30-60 min): Comprehensive understanding
- **Combination**: Do practice during week, deep dive on weekend

## Contributing Your Own

As you master topics, consider creating your own deep dives:

1. **Format**: Follow the existing template
2. **Structure**: 
   - Introduction and motivation
   - Fundamentals
   - Advanced usage
   - Performance analysis
   - Real-world examples
   - Common pitfalls
   - References
3. **Depth**: Assume reader knows basics, go deep
4. **Code**: Runnable examples with explanations
