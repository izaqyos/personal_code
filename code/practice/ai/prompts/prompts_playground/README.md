# Prompt Engineering Playground

A hands-on workspace for practicing and mastering prompt engineering techniques with AI assistants.

## Overview

This project contains exercises and experiments in crafting effective prompts to achieve specific outcomes from AI systems. The goal is to develop practical skills in communicating with AI to get accurate, useful, and targeted responses.

## Course Reference

These exercises are based on the **Checkpoint Prompt Engineering Course**:  
🔗 [Prompt Engineering Exercise - Checkpoint Wiki](https://wiki.checkpoint.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CPTRAIN&title=Prompt+Engineering+Exercise)

## Purpose

- Practice writing clear, effective prompts
- Experiment with different prompting techniques
- Document what works (and what doesn't)
- Build a personal reference of prompt patterns

## Getting Started

1. Review the course materials from the Checkpoint Wiki
2. Create exercise files in this directory
3. Test prompts with your AI assistant of choice
4. Document findings and iterate
