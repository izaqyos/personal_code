# Streamlit Learning Project

This project is dedicated to learning the Streamlit library by building various examples and applications.
We will explore Streamlit's features, from basic widgets to more advanced concepts, including data visualization, interactivity, and app deployment.

## Project Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of Streamlit.
- Learn how to use various Streamlit widgets.
- Explore data handling and visualization with Streamlit.
- Build interactive web applications.
- Gain experience in structuring and deploying Streamlit apps.

## Getting Started
(To be updated as the project progresses)

To set up the project environment:
1.  Ensure you have Conda installed.
2.  Create the Conda environment: `conda create --name streamlit-claude python=3.9` (or your preferred Python version).
3.  Activate the environment: `conda activate streamlit-claude`.
4.  Install dependencies (starting with Streamlit): `pip install streamlit`
    (Further dependencies will be listed in a `requirements.txt` file as we add them).

(Further instructions on running the app will be added here.)

### Running the Application

1.  Ensure your Conda environment `streamlit-claude` is activated: `conda activate streamlit-claude`
2.  Navigate to the project root directory (where `app.py` is located).
3.  Run the command: `streamlit run app.py`

### Running Tests

1.  Ensure your Conda environment `streamlit-claude` is activated: `conda activate streamlit-claude`
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run the command: `pytest`
