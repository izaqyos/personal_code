riddle:
There is only one 7-digit number that has both of these qualities:

First, its digits are in ascending order, in the sense that each digit after the first one (that is, the digit in the millionth place) is greater than the digit before.
Second, when it is multiplied by 2020, the resulting product is a 10-digit number in which every digit from 0 to 9 appears once.
PART I: What is the 7-digit number?

PART II: Show your Node.js (or whatever language) code that you used to figure out the answer.
