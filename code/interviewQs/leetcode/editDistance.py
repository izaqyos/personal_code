"""
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')"

algorith. levenshtein dist.
recursion. dist of X[1..m] Y[1..n] = { one of:
1. max(m,n) if min(m,n) = 0. (this means either X is empty so |Y| insertions, or Y empty so |X| deletions). stop cond
if X[m] == Y[n] D(X[m],Y[n]) == D(X[m-1],Y[n-1]). since last characters are the same
else
2. min of following
  2.1 D(X[m-1], Y[n]) +1, del X[m] 
  2.2 D(X[m], Y[n-1]) +1,  insert Y[N] to end of X so X = X[1..m]Yn
  2.2 D(X[m-1], Y[n-1]) +1,  replace Xm w/ Xn
}

can be imporved by DP, use matrix |X|+1 by |Y| +1 where m(i,j) is dist X[1..i]Y[1..j]
M[0][1..j] = j (insert j chars from Y to empty X)
M[1..i][0] = i (delete i chars from X to be empty as Y)
M[i][j] == M[i-1][j-1] if X[i] == Y[J] (take from diagonal)
M[i][j] == min of three option: 
  1 M[i-1][j]) +1, take row above when del X[i] 
  2 M[i][j-1]) +1, take left column when insert Y[j] to end of X
  2 M([i-1][j-1]) +1,  replace X[i] w/ Y[j]
