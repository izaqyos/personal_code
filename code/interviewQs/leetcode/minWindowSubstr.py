"""

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:

Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

Idea:
Keep to dictionaries of T chars freq. one as readonly and a second copy for running match candidate
scan S, keep track of i, lmi, hmi which are running index, low match index and high match index
lmi hmi start as -1
for each char if it is in T match dict if lmi is -1 set to i, update counter, check if full match,etc..
This will fail if matched overlap, e.g. 'bcab', 'ba'
instead sliding window. 
use same dict but once match found move left side index until first match. 
if len < min set as possible return
add back this char to dict and set left index +1
