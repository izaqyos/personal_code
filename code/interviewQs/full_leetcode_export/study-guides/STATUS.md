## 🎓 Study Recommendations

### For Interview Prep (2-4 weeks):
**Week 1:** Graphs → Tries → Heaps (address gaps)  
**Week 2:** Design → DP → Binary Search  
**Week 3:** Stack/Queue → Backtracking → Greedy  
**Week 4:** Review all, practice mixed problems

### For Long-term Mastery (2-3 months):
Follow the order in INDEX.md, solving 5-10 problems per guide

### Quick Review (3-5 days before interview):
Focus on: LRU Cache, Binary Search on Answer, Two Heaps, Monotonic Stack, Union-Find
