# CCNA Refresher Course 🌐

> **A comprehensive refresher for experienced network professionals returning to CCNA material**

## 📋 Overview

This project is designed for someone who completed CCNA training ~11 years ago and needs to refresh their knowledge while catching up with the modern CCNA curriculum (200-301). The current CCNA consolidates the old CCNA Routing & Switching, Security, Cloud, and Wireless tracks into one comprehensive certification.

### What's Changed Since Your Last CCNA?

| Then (Pre-2020)                    | Now (CCNA 200-301)                           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple CCNA tracks               | Single consolidated CCNA                     |
| RIP, EIGRP, OSPF routing           | Focus on OSPF (single-area & multi-area)     |
| Basic switching                    | Advanced VLAN, STP, EtherChannel             |
| Minimal automation                 | **Network Automation & Programmability** 🆕  |
| CLI-only management                | REST APIs, JSON, YAML, Ansible, Python       |
| Traditional data centers           | **SDN & Controller-based architecttic** 🆕   |
| IPv4 primary focus                 | IPv6 parity (dual-stack mandatory)           |
| Basic security                     | Zero Trust, Threat defense, MFA              |
| Physical networking only           | Wireless fundamenttic (802.11, WLCs)         |
