# Obsidian PKM Guide for Developers & Team Managers

> A comprehensive guide to mastering Obsidian for personal knowledge management, tailored for developers and engineering managers.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning path and reference for using **Obsidian** as a knowledge management system optimized for:

- **Team Management** — tracking 1:1s, team goals, performance notes, and project decisions
- **Technical Knowledge** — documenting programming concepts, architecture decisions, code snippets, and debugging notes
- **Skill Development** — maintaining a personal learning roadmap, tracking progress, and building a second brain for engineering growth
- **Project & Task Management** — organizing development workflows, sprint notes, and technical debt tracking

## 👤 Background

This guide is written from the perspective of:
- An experienced software developer familiar with multiple programming languages and frameworks
- A team manager balancing technical depth with leadership responsibilities
- A power user of **NeoVIM**, **VS Code**, and **Cursor** — expecting keyboard-driven, efficient workflows
